# gobonsai

`gobonsai` is a bonsai tree generator, written in `go` using [gocui](https://github.com/awesome-gocui/gocui).

This project wouldn't be here if it weren't for its *roots*! `gobonsai` is a port
of [cbonsai](https://gitlab.com/jallbrit/cbonsai), which was written in `C` and was itself a port
of [bonsai.sh](https://gitlab.com/jallbrit/bonsai.sh), which was written in `bash` and was itself a port
of [bonsai](https://avelican.github.io/bonsai/), which was written in `javascript`.
